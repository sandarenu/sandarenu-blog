## Welcome ...

I'm testing my new blog powered by hugo and github pages. I've bein using [blogger](http://sandarenu.blogspot.com) for sometime. 
Blogger is really nice platform, but sometimes formatting a post takes lot of effort. Especially when I need to 
add some code samples it is not that easy. 

I love markdown, and I use it all the time in my day-today work. So wanted to try out static site generation using markdown. 
Initially I tried [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), but it was very bulky. Recently I found out about [hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com) 
and it looks very nice and compact. It is really easy to get started with hugo. 

I'm planning to run this blog parallel to my blogger powered blog as a trial. If successful I'll completely migrate to this blog.

Still there are quite few things to be done here like site design and importing my posts from blogger. So stay tuned..
